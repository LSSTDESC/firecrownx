# Firecrown Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating the use of Firecrown, a Python package that provides the DESC framework to implement likelihoods, as well as specific likelihood implementations. Firecrown is intended to be usable from external statistical analysis tools.

Currently, it supports Cobaya, CosmoSIS, and NumCosmo, providing the necessary classes or modules to allow users the sampling frameworks to call any Firecrown likelihood from within those samplers.
